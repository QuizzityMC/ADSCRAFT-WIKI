# The Nordian Shogunate

### The Nordian Shogunate

The Nordian Shogunate is north of Thalizar, and west of Luxuria.

It is led by the First Shogun and Supreme Admiral, Henry Wauzivuff Ford I

### Cities

The Nordian Shogunate has as of current two cities, the Capital Bergentia, and the town of Kastavia, of Kastavia Province. However, there are plans to add provinces and cities, with each province given as a fief to new citizens. There is even a new province being founded, attracting vast quantities of new players, called the Dragon Plateau.

### Geography

It is located West of Thalizar on the foothills of Mount Thalizar.

### History

The kingdom was founded when an explorer, Henry Wauzivuff Ford, and his crew from an original Kingdom of Nordia in a different continent, Forria, as Henry calls it, explored the oceans and found the land on which our kingdoms exist. He was excited and wanted to return and inform the king of the original Nordian Kingdom, King Edward "Finneus" Nord I, but could not find his way back. Henry and his crew eventually settled in the new land which they named after their original home, Nordia.\
\
The Nordian Shogunate was formally established as a province in January 2024\*.&#x20;

### Culture

The original Nordia originally got their culture from the exiles of other kingdoms the original Nordia's continent. This mixed culture of course carried over to Henry Wauzivuff and his crew, being originally from the original Nordia.

When it was a vassal of Thalizar, the Shogunate of Nordia's official religion was Pandituism. But when it became independent, it's official religion became Nordian Traditionalism, but it also officially recognizes the Coronian faith and unofficially every single other religion ever,

### Politics

The Nordian Shogunate is in a very strong treaty with the Thalizar Empire. Thalizar supplies Nordia with weapons and Nordia helps Thalizar in all of its operations. This means that by proxy, the Nordian Shogunate is in a trade alliance with Luxuria. However, a Luxurian named Greaful has killed the Shogun Henry Wauzivuff and took his items. Greaful's refusal to a trial and giving back Henry's possessions strained their relations even moreg. Because of this, Henry Wauzivuff has signed a weaponry deal with the Thalizanian military and is determined to sanction Luxuria and prohibit Luxurians from entering the province, and allows soldiers to attack them on sight if they enter the country.

On March 1, 2024, Nordia declared itself independent from Thalizar.

On March 1, 2024, a peace treaty between Luxuria and Nordia was signed. The treaty allowed Luxurians to enter the country without repercussions and Nordians to enter Luxuria without repercussions.

On March 3, 2024, General RainyLyric blew up Henry Wauzivuff's house and also the Bergentia Town Hall with respawn anchors, claiming that Henry destroyed Rainy's inn, a crime Henry did not commit. This led to both sides getting jail time in the original timeline and a war between Nordia and Thalizar in another.

Military

> Nordia has been given armor and weaponry by General RainyLyric14977 in a military treaty. Shogun Henry Wauzivuff is interested in the use of planez in warfare, and has pitched the idea of having an air force to The Emperor and the head General. Thalizar and Nordia are the only countries to have an air force, and will likely have an advantage in many wars to come.
>
> Air Force Members specialize in ranged combat and potions, tridents, and multishot crossbows for maximum arrow output. Air force members should also wear elytras and carry water buckets for safe landing, and minecarts and rails to quickly take off again if grounded. They are expected to make up most of Nordia's military, along with the navy and cavalry.
>
> An Air Force may be invested into, utilizing minecart planes, bows, potions, missiles, and most importantly, maces.
>
> RainyLyric was the Supreme Commander of the Northern Fleet until he became the equivalent of Enver Pasha.
>
> After the Luxuria-Nordia peace treaty, Henry has been trying to start an alliance with Luxuria but has been unsuccessful so far.

### Trivia

* At the moment Nordia's founding is being propped up by its closest ally, The Thalizar Empire.

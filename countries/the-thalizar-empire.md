'One player, Chicken, said "A world without Stormton would be like a toast without butter"'

Stormton was rewarded with peace and prosperity, but by season 5, It had almost disappeared due to a lack of new players. However, In Season 6, all the players and ideas that belonged to stormton were reborn, in the Thalizar Empire.

The Thalizar Empire, Created by QuizzityMC, who was the old king of Stormton, ADSBARCHER, with a new name, was a nation that quickly grew, as it was founded when there were barely any other countries in the world.

It has a prime minister, RainyLyric14977 and an Emperor, QuizzityMC. It is a constitutional Monarchy with a parliament located in the city of Civitas. It was an ally of the USSA until it disbanded itself, and gave the land to the prime minister at the time, tgforce14 to start his own province, which has been named the Bosque. Later, after tgforce14 lost the next election on the 16'th of March 2024, with it being won by RainyLyric14977, with tgforce14 also abandoning the Bosque.

Nordia has become allied with Thalizar, RainyLyric14977 has renamed himself Lucifer and has become a complete Devil who kills lots of people, and Nordia is rising as a new power far away in the snowy areas. Thalizar is still a forceful power who's Emperor, QuizzityMC, and Prime minister, Tramountanas, who are having an agenda of reform and prosperity.

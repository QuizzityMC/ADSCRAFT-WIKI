It was led by Erezamar (erezdaberez) and it's capital city is Stormton

Tension has been building with the Thalizar Empire, after former Prime Minister tgforce14 declared Luxuria a national threat. This lead to tension with the Nordia, especially because they are right next to Luxuria. This tension increased after Greaful & Tounimas murdered shogun Henry Wauzivuff and held his items hostage. This ended when on 1 March 2024, a peace treaty was signed with Nordia and Luxuria. The country has declined in importance, but is still maintained by its core group of leaders.

During October 2024, Luxuria eventually folded, with a major confrontation between Thalizar And Nova taking place in the territory, causing major damage to it as well.

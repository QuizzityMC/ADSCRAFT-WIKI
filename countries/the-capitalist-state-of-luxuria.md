Tension has been building with the Thalizar Empire, after Prime Minister tgforce14 declared Luxuria a national threat. This lead to tension with the Nordia, especially because they are right next to Luxuria. This tension increased after Greaful & Tounimas murdered shogun Henry Wauzivuff and held his items hostage. This ended when on 1 March 2024, a peace treaty was signed with Nordia and Luxuria. The country has declined in importance, but is still maintained by its core group of leaders.

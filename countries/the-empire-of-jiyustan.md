### History

On November 21 of 2024, President River was granted legal ownership of a piece of land situated just outside the suburb of Rextonville, which is situated in the Thalizar Empire.

The same day as the land was given to President River, she founded the Kingdom of Serenthia on the land. During this time, a cathedral, farm, post office, and a train station connecting to Rextonville were built.

On December 12 of 2024, President River officially changed the name of the nation to the Empire of Jiyustan and announced plans to expand the nation.

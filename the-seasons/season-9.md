# Season 9

Season 9 has been the longest season so far in ADSCRAFT, lasting from Early October 2023 to early February 2024. We  120 Members in the Guilded Channel, and we reintroduced many OG's. We have many countries on the server, and we are heading somewhat towards the civilisation gaming challenge that we attempted in seasons 1 and 2. We also introduced the fall or Conquer Videos, which were very successful.

# The Seasons!

ADSCRAFT Season One lasted 2 months, and only during this period did the Admins discover how to use plugins and access OP. Colossal towns were built, (as shown in the photo gallery below) and, with the power of plugins, the server finally became safe from people joining on others' accounts and finding secret base locations. Most OG players argue that this was one of the most fun servers that happened, as there were many hilarious incidents such as the events surrounding the court case of Ame\_The\_wolf. Sadly, on the 4'th of March 2023, Microsoft, the owner of Minecraft, decided to take down the illegal copy, immediately terminating all the progress on the server.

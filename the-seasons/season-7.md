# Season 7

ADSCRAFT Season Seven Really Took off. Over 35 Players were in our Revolt.chat Channel, and people began to make huge towns, cities and civilisations. The Server Finally upgraded to Proper (Still Free) Hosting, and we had a website. It also marked when we began making more cinematic videos, and progressing forwards with the youtube channel.

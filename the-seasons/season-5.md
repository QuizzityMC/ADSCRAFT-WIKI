# Season 5

ADSCRAFT Season 5 Is when things truly started to go uphill. As shown in the video below, it featured a complicated building map, which lasted until it, too, was closed down. However, the world remains, as it was revisited in the beginning of the One Year Celebrations, and this was the first time when the server was fully opened to the public. The Video Below Shows the server in it's early days, as season 5 was flourishing. The Beginning of the Video underneath shows when we revisited it.
